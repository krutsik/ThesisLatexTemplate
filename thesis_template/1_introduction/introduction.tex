Mobile advertising is an inseparable part in today's mobile application development. In many cases advertising enables the developer to offer their application to users for free. The most common way advertisements are displayed to the user is taking up a big part, if not all, of the device's screen real estate. Also commonly, the developer has little control of the content of the advertisements, which often trick users into clicking the link within the advertisement instead of closing it.

\section{Motivation}
More often than not, in-application advertisements prove to be distracting to the user and, in extreme cases, even degrade the user experience to a point where the user decides to stop using the application.  In addition, usually the user tends to just ignore the advertisements. This makes the advertising model ineffective and compromises the reputation of the application, as well as the developer, without significant gain for any party.

Advertisements influence people's attitude towards advertising by a great deal. When advertisements employ techniques that irritate or bother the user, then the user is likely to perceive them as an unwanted influence.\cite{chowdhury2010consumer} A less intrusive and more intuitive, user feedback based method of displaying advertisements would improve the user experience of the application with the added benefit of users being more likely to see the content of the advertisement.

\section{Contributions}
The goal of this thesis is to describe current advertisement models for mobile applications and explore new mechanisms to integrate advertisements into the flow of an application more seamlessly.

As a result, a new mechanism, namely \textit{Gesture Ads}, will be designed and implemented. This mechanism will display advertisements in a way that is less distracting for the user and has less noticeable of an impact on using the application. It will also give the user a chance to give honest feedback on advertisement topics they like and dislike, which allows providing more relevant advertising to the user, without relying on profiling algorithms.

The objectives of the new mechanism are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To make the application more enjoyable for the user, by offering less intrusive advertising and advertisements more relevant to the individual user.
  \item To ease the integration of mobile advertisements into the applications and give the developer more freedom to focus on user experience, without having to worry about advertising mechanics.
  \item To enable the advertiser to offer content relevant to the user, thereby increasing the user's perception of the product as well as the likelihood of the user choosing to learn more about the offer.
\end{itemize}

To integrate \textit{Gesture Ads} into an application, a Java library for Android \footnote{http://www.android.com/}, was created. Application developers can use the library, which would integrate advertisements more seamlessly into the flow of the application. It would allow the application to receive all the necessary data via a push notification from the server and then display a very minimalist form of it to the user, without taking up too much of the very limited screen space of the device. The application should still retain usability for any time-critical activities with the advertisement being movable if necessary.

The user can focus their attention on the advertisement when the time is most suitable. They can then use a spread or a tap gesture to view a more detailed description of the advertisement. If they have finished reading the advertisement they can flick it either left to show disinterest or right to show interest. Data will then be sent back to the server to be processed and stored. The server application can then take into account, among other things, the user's preferred topics and location to send advertisements more relevant to the user.

The new mechanism was evaluated and compared to classical mobile advertising based on the opinions of a set of 25 people. According the the results, the proposed mechanism is more effective than classical methods of advertising. It is more user-friendly, less intrusive and draws more attention to the advertisement from the user.

\section{Outline}

\noindent \textbf{Chapter 2}: describes the research question that this thesis focuses on and its necessity.

\noindent \textbf{Chapter 3}: describes the most popular mobile advertising frameworks used today and discusses the advantages and drawbacks of each. It also takes a closer look at some of the more unorthodox advertising frameworks that do not follow the most common patterns of mobile advertising and take user experience regarding mobile advertisements to the next level.

\noindent \textbf{Chapter 4}: describes in detail the development process and the final proposed mechanism. The developed font-end library as well as the server application used to test the library.

\noindent \textbf{Chapter 5}: takes a closer look at user feedback regarding the advertising method as well as mobile advertisements in general. In addition, this chapter explains the evaluation of the proposed solution.

\noindent \textbf{Chapter 6}: concludes the thesis with a summary and future research directions.
